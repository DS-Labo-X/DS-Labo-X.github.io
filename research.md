# Research Themes

Our research focuses on **advanced catalyst design**, **operando spectroscopy**, and **the physics of materials**. We aim to build a deep understanding of structure–performance relationships in energy and chemical systems.

## Key Topics
1. **Metal Nanoparticles & Alloys**  
   Phase control and morphology tuning for enhanced catalytic activity.

2. **Liquid Metal Catalysis**  
   Harnessing interfacial dynamics and unique physical properties.

3. **Biomass Conversion & Electrocatalysis**  
   HMF-to-FDCA, CO₂ hydrogenation, and fuel cell reactions.

4. **Operando Spectroscopy**  
   HAXPES, XAFS, DRIFTS, and synchrotron-based techniques.

5. **AI-Driven Catalyst Design**  
   Combining machine learning with DFT for predictive discovery.
